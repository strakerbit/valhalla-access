# Final Project - Quickpass Management for Valhalla Condominium

---

## Project Description:
This project implements a management system for the access of residents to the Valhalla Condominium. The system allows for the registration, consultation, deletion, and blocking of Quickpasses, which are the access stickers assigned to each resident. Additionally, it keeps track of accesses through text files and generates statistical reports on Quickpass usage.

The project is divided into three modules:
1. **Quickpass Management Module**: Allows registration, consultation, blocking, and deletion of Quickpasses.
2. **Access Management Module**: Logs accesses in a text file and enables historical queries.
3. **Reporting Module**: Generates reports on the usage and status of Quickpasses and access to the condominium.
